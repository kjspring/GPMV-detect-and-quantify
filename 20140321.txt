# I. Randomly makes segments through the detected object.
#    1. Find the center of the object.
#    2. Find the first pixel of the object.
#    3. Find the






Start from some edge point.
#    2. Determine the angle
#    2. Average over 5 pixels, save in data frame as first pixel to avg intensity.
#    3. From that point move down 5 pixels and average the 5px^2 area and save as next point in the data frame.
#    4. From that point move right 5 pixels and average the 5px^2 area and save as next point in the data frame.
#    5. Repeat step 2.
#    6. From that point move left 5 pixels and average the 5px^2 area and save as the next point in the data frame.
#    7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the center of the object is reached.
#    8. Randomly generate a number between 1-360 to determine the angle.
#    9. From the angle value generated
